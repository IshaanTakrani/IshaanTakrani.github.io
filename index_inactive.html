        <p class="body-text" style="color: #29769d">
          I was introduced to programming when I was 11 years old. My
          sixth-grade teacher started a lesson about building and controlling a
          Lego Mindstorms robot using the EV3 module. Since then, my skills and
          passion for computer science have grown and led me here. I attend
          Ontario Tech University as a computer science student, and I am
          currently working on many computer software and hardware-based
          projects to learn more about the field of computer science and its
          impact on society.

            From 2018 to 2022, I attended secondary school. Coming into high
            school as barely a teenager and leaving as nearly an adult, My high
            school experience was full of lessons that will stay with me for the
            rest of my life. Some of my greatest high school achievements
            include being the co-founder of an all-new computer-engineering
            club, assisting an instructor in the creation of computer
            engineering lessons that I exclusively taught to 20+ students, and
            being selected for a student exchange program with a school in the
            Netherlands.

            I am currently a computer science student at Ontario Tech
            University, and I have learned many components in the field of
            computer science, including programming languages such as: Python,
            C++, Java, Assembly, as well as programming conventions, computer
            architecture, and advanced problem solving skills.I currently hold a
            GPA of 3.88 and I am enthusiastic about improving my academic
            performance and learning new computer science topics in the future.
