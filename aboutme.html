    <p class="body_text">
      Since I first got my hands on a code-controlled robot, the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 module, I knew that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Tell a computer what to do, and watch as it did it exactly.
      Since then, my skills and passion for computer science has grown and led me here, a computer scientist in a computer-centric world.
      I attend Ontario Tech University as a student in computer science, and I am currently working on many computer software and hardware-based topics in an attempt to learn more about computer science and its impact on society.
