        Since I first got my hands on a code-controlled robot, the LEGO
        Mindstorms EV3 module, I knew that this is what I wanted to do for the
        rest of my life. Tell a computer what to do, and watch as it did it
        exactly. Since then, my skills and passion for computer science has
        grown and led me here. I attend Ontario Tech University as a student in
        computer science, and I am currently working on many computer software
        and hardware-based topics in an attempt to learn more about computer
        science and its impact on society.

          From 2018 to 2022, I attended secondary school. Coming into high
          school as barely a teenager and leaving as nearly an adult, My high
          school experience was full of knowledge and lessons that will stay
          with me for the rest of my life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some of my greatest high school achievements include being the
          co-founder of an all new computer-engineering club, assisting an
          instructor in the creation of computer engineering lessons that I
          taught to the class, and being selected for a student exchange program
          with a school in the Netherlands.

          I am currently a computer science student at Ontario Tech University,
          and in my first year, I have learned many topics in the field of
          computer science, including new programming languages, programming
          conventions, computer architecture, and developed my problem-solving
          skills.
